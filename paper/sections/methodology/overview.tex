\subsection{Overview}

Our approach enhances the Current Population Survey (CPS) with information from the IRS Public Use File (PUF) through a multi-stage process:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Train quantile regression forests on PUF tax records to learn distributions of tax-related variables
    \item Generate a synthetic dataset that combines PUF tax precision with CPS-like demographic detail
    \item Stack these synthetic records alongside the original CPS records
    \item Optimize household weights to match administrative benchmarks while determining the optimal mix of original and synthetic records
\end{enumerate}

This method preserves the CPS's demographic richness and household relationships while incorporating the PUF's precise tax information. Each component is detailed in the following sections.
