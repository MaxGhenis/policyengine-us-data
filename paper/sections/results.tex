\section{Results}

We evaluate our enhanced dataset against administrative targets by constructing a loss matrix (defined in utils/loss.py) measuring relative deviations from:

\subsection{IRS Statistics of Income Targets}

By AGI bracket and filing status, we track:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Adjusted gross income totals
    \item Return counts
    \item Wages, salaries, and tips
    \item Business net profits and losses (separately)
    \item Capital gains (gross amounts and distributions)
    \item Ordinary dividends
    \item Partnership and S-corporation income and losses
    \item Qualified dividends
    \item Taxable interest income
    \item Pension income
    \item Social Security benefits
    \item Estate income and losses
    \item Tax-exempt interest
    \item IRA distributions
    \item Rent and royalty income and losses
    \item Taxable pension income
    \item Taxable Social Security
    \item Unemployment compensation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Census Population Targets}

From Census projections:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Population counts for each single year of age from 0 to 85
\end{itemize}

\subsection{CBO Program Totals}

From Congressional Budget Office projections:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Income tax revenue
    \item SNAP benefit payments
    \item Social Security benefit payments
    \item SSI payments
    \item Unemployment compensation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{EITC Statistics}

From Treasury data:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Number of returns claiming EITC by number of qualifying children
    \item Total EITC amounts by number of qualifying children
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Other Targets}

From various government sources:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Healthcare spending by age group and type
    \item Child support payments
    \item Housing costs and subsidies
    \item Market income losses
\end{itemize}

The reweighting procedure minimizes the relative squared error between weighted sums of these variables and their administrative targets. 

% TODO: Add specific quantitative results showing:
% - Initial deviations from targets in base CPS
% - Final deviations after enhancement
% - Distribution of weights between original and synthetic records
