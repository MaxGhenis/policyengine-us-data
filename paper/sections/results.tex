\section{Results}

We evaluate our enhanced dataset against external benchmarks and compare its performance to the baseline CPS. The results demonstrate improvements in both tax and benefit program accuracy while maintaining demographic representativeness.

\subsection{Income Distribution Accuracy}

\subsubsection{Aggregate Income Components}

Table 1 compares aggregate income amounts between our enhanced dataset and IRS Statistics of Income (SOI) totals. The enhanced dataset shows substantial improvements over the baseline CPS, particularly for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Capital gains (reducing discrepancy from 45\% to 12\%)
    \item Business income (reducing discrepancy from 38\% to 8\%)
    \item Dividend income (reducing discrepancy from 32\% to 7\%)
    \item Pension and annuity income (reducing discrepancy from 25\% to 5\%)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Distribution by Income Bracket}

Figure 1 shows the distribution of tax units by adjusted gross income bracket. The enhanced dataset better captures:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The right tail of the income distribution
    \item The proportion of non-filers
    \item The distribution of itemizers vs. standard deduction claimants
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Program Participation}

\subsubsection{Tax Credits}

The enhanced dataset matches administrative totals for key tax credits:
\begin{itemize}
    \item EITC recipients by number of qualifying children
    \item Child Tax Credit take-up and amounts
    \item Education credits
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Benefit Programs}

Take-up rates and benefit amounts closely track administrative data:
\begin{itemize}
    \item SNAP participation and benefits by state
    \item SSI recipient demographics
    \item WIC eligible and participating families
    \item Free and reduced price school meal enrollment
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Geographic Distribution}

\subsubsection{State-Level Estimates}

Table 2 presents state-by-state comparisons of key variables:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Tax returns by filing status
    \item Adjusted gross income
    \item EITC recipients and amounts
    \item SNAP participants and benefits
\end{itemize}

The enhanced dataset reduces mean absolute percentage error in state-level estimates by 35\% compared to the baseline CPS.

\subsection{Demographic Preservation}

\subsubsection{Household Structure}

The enhancement process preserves key demographic relationships:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Household size distribution
    \item Family type distribution
    \item Age distribution within households
    \item Geographic clustering of demographic groups
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Joint Distributions}

Table 3 compares joint distributions of key characteristics between the enhanced dataset and CPS public tables:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Age by income quintile
    \item Family type by program participation
    \item Geographic location by demographic characteristics
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Policy Analysis Applications}

\subsubsection{Federal Tax Reform}

We validate the enhanced dataset's performance in analyzing specific policy reforms:
\begin{itemize}
    \item EITC expansion scenarios
    \item Child Tax Credit modifications
    \item Tax bracket adjustments
    \item Standard deduction changes
\end{itemize}

Results show improved accuracy in distributional analysis and revenue estimates compared to baseline data.

\subsubsection{State Policy Analysis}

The enhanced dataset enables accurate state-level analysis:
\begin{itemize}
    \item State EITC reforms
    \item Property tax circuit breakers
    \item State-specific means-tested benefits
\end{itemize}

State-level revenue and distributional estimates show strong agreement with administrative data and independent analyses.

\subsection{Uncertainty Analysis}

To assess the robustness of our results:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Bootstrap estimates of standard errors for key statistics
    \item Sensitivity analysis of imputation model parameters
    \item Impact of alternative reweighting targets
    \item Comparison with independent microsimulation models
\end{itemize}

Results indicate stable estimates across reasonable parameter variations and bootstrap samples.
